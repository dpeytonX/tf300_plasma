Plasma Active Image for ASUS TF300T tablet

This project aims to create a custom image for the TF300T tablet with Plasma Active project from KDE installed.

The idea came from the ArchLinux project which successfully runs native linux on this tablet.

TODO:
-figure out what the kernel.blob is and if a custom one is needed
-figure out which base distribution to use
--candidates are: Kubuntu, OpenSuse, Mer, Meego
